`coastalwalkr` is another mapbot, inspired by Matt Dray's [`londonmapbot`](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot) and my [`narrowbotR`](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/narrowbotR). When up and running the `coastalwalkr` will take walks along the coast of Great Britain.

### TO DO
- [x] pull GB coastline from `{rnaturalearth}`
- [x] identify walking mechanism to follow coast in one direction, accounting for coastal geometry
- [x] create twitter account
- [ ] explore open data: nearest RLNI station, nearest public transport
- [ ] identify tweet strategy
- [ ] write script for tweeting
- [ ] write GH Action workflow for automation
